# Espresso
A quick shot of ES6 instead that old Coffee. 

This is a command line tool for converting CoffeeScript files into their ES6 equivalents*.

*As close as possible, anyway.

Available through NPM

```bash
npm install espresso-transformer
```

Using as CLI:
Espresso will look for `.coffee` files if a directory is passed in as the first argument, and write the new `.es6` files to the same directory.

(Given there is a directory called coffeescript)
```bash
espresso coffeescript/
```

To add the JSX transformer:

```bash
espresso coffeescript/ --jsx
```

To change which files to look for:

```bash
espresso coffeescript/ --match .coffeescript
```

To change the file type being written after transformation:

```
espresso coffeescript/ --extension .js
```
